Intro
-------------------------

Dear Robert,

Why did you [1|do this] to me? After [2|everything we've been through], here I am alone.

1: (the event in question, without giving too much away)
I wish I'd [5|seen it coming], maybe then I would've [4|been ready]. Maybe then I would've left you behind, and avoided this [3|heartache].

2: (background between the two characters)
When we met, I thought you were [3|a pig]; not much really changed when we [4|fell in love], either. God I was [5|so stupid].

Memories

3: (memories of their meeting)
You were always so cocky about everything. Even when we met. You waltzed up to me, Cheshire grin on your face, and spouted that stupid pickup line. I almost walked away right then; I was embarrassed for both of us. Still, you were the only one to talk to me all night, and I was still getting over a bad breakup, and I felt like I needed something casual.

I was surprised as you were when I called you the next weekend.

4: (memories of falling in love)
You were always so cocky about everything. Maybe that's why I fell for you. Your attitude towards life, the way you always seemed so sure of yourself. I have a confession to make: the night we broke down, my phone wasn't dead; I just wanted so badly to spend some time with you, I didn't care if it was at the party or on the shoulder of a road.

You took me that night, and I was so happy to give.

5: (memories of quarrels)
You were always so cocky about everything. You were convinced you were right every time. When we locked horns, you would never let it go, like it was some kind of personal vendetta. Either with me, or with whatever problem of the week had come up, you were as focused as a laser, to the detriment of everything else.

I admit, I felt like leaving you a few times; your attitude can be grating after weeks of conflict. I still wish I could undo all of that arguing. How much time did we waste, Rob? How much do you regret it? Do you regret it at all?

Hopes and dreams

6: (adventure, living life)
“Live your life while you can!” my mother always told me, so we did. We saw the usual cliché tourist traps, went hiking and camping, etc. But it wasn’t the scenery I was traveling for, not really. It was you, the way you always made the world feel so massive. I don’t think I would’ve kept going if you hadn’t dragged me along sometimes, but I’m glad you did. Those places, those foods, those occasional monsoons will be with me forever.

7: (family, friends, children)
 “Live your life while you can!” my mother always told me, so we did. I’d always wanted a family; a husband and two children, a boy and a girl. Such a cliché image of a nuclear family, but it was beautiful. I think you knew I wanted that, and I know you wanted to wait, but I’ll never forget the look on your face when I told you I was pregnant with Ashley. 

8: (career, pursuing personal goals)
“Live your life while you can!” my mother always told me, so we did. Do you remember that little café across from the old pharmacy? I bought it. Don’t act surprised, you know I can’t work at the restaurant forever. I’ve taken out a mortgage to help pay for it. It gets good business, and for the first time I’m planning for the future.

Loss and remorse

I wish I could tell you this in person.
