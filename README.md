## Outline

"Dear Robert" is a branching narrative storyline, possibly utilizing a ren'ai-style interface. This type of narrative is called an [Epistolary Novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel).

The story begins with a letter adressed "Dear Robert", which is chronologically the *last* letter written in the game.

```
Dear Robert,

Why did you do this to me? We've been through a lot together, but here I am alone. 

(etc.)
```

The idea is that the player is presented with this letter, and they must reconstruct the events that occured for themselves. In doing so, the resulting narrative will either have this writer abandoned and heartbroken, or "Robert" will be dead. Either way, it'll be difficult to write a convincing first/last letter that covers both possibilities. I could just have an ellipses at the bottom which is replaced by the appropriate text based on the player's choices.

This can be done using a web interface (in browser, e.g. Depression Quest), or coded using Ren'Py, or even implemented using a wiki. This is an incredibly important prototype, because I've never really had any experience with narrative; all of my skills focus on the nuts and bolts of game development. If I'm ever going to be a successful designer, I need to learn to write.
